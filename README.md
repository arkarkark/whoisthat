# Who is That

## Overview

I recently got a new job and wanted to hit the ground running. I'd
already called people the wrong name during the interview process and
I have a hard time remembering people's names and faces (especially if
they're not on a bike). Who is that is a quiz web app that shows you
faces and helps you learn who they are. You can often get a list of
people from linkedin or the company website.
